# Scheduling
This is a proof of concept I did for a salon

## Installation
To install node on Mac, Windows, or Linux follow the instructions here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

 To install MongoDB on Mac:
  
  Install homebrew : 
  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
 Then
 ```bash
 brew tap mongodb/brew
 ```
 If you have already done this for a previous installation of MongoDB, you can skip this step

After that run
```bash
brew install mongodb-community@5.0
```
To start MongoDB
```bash
brew services start mongodb-community@5.0
```
To Stop MongoDB
```bash
brew services stop mongodb-community@5.0
```
